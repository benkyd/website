## Ben Kyd  
**Embedded Acceleration & Kernel Engineer**

I'm a programmer, engineer, amature photographer and nature lover.

I work across embedded systems, electrical engineering, hardware acceleration, and graphics. I’m interested in the kind of problems that sit close to the metal-firmware, FPGAs, real-time performance, and systems where software and hardware are tightly coupled.

I’ve worked in roles spanning firmware engineering, embedded acceleration, open hardware development, and FPGA toolchains, with experience at companies like Apple, Intel and ChamSys, as well as through my own consultancy, Ben Labs Ltd.

A lot of my best work happens outside of work. I spend significant time on open source, low-level personal projects, and experiments-from building my own RISC-V emulator to writing game engines and custom operating systems.

My GitHub is the best place to find what I’m currently working on: [github.com/benkyd](https://github.com/benkyd)

### Highlights

- Firmware, RTOS, DMA, bare-metal drivers (C/C++, Rust)
- Graphics pipelines, modern real-time ray-tracing, software rendering
- Open source contributor (Zephyr, Meshtastic, SDR++)
- Systems integration: from schematic to silicon to software
