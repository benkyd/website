When high performance LLMs first landed, it was a novel technology that we all messed with, tried to break, 

We were very quick to incorporate them into our development workflow, with tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, they were immediately in our IDEs, for instant and immediate use, one hotkey to accept the code suggestion and one hotkey for a code review.

Our reliance and dependency on these tools grew, and it grew very quickly. It seemed like it was overnight that the "tech bro" meta for engineering had completely shifted from "10x developers" to "vibe coders". It was the great democratisation of engineering, all of a sudden, everybody was of the same calibre of engineer, an expert on everything and able to propose solutions immediately.
