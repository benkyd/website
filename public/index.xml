      <title>ChatGPT Detox and the harm of LLMs in engineering</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When high performance LLMs first landed, it was a novel technology that we all messed with, tried to break,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were very quick to incorporate them into our development workflow, with tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer, they were immediately in our IDEs, for instant and immediate use, one hotkey to accept the code suggestion and one hotkey for a code review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our reliance and dependency on these tools grew, and it grew very quickly. It seemed like it was overnight that the &amp;ldquo;tech bro&amp;rdquo; meta for engineering had completely shifted from &amp;ldquo;10x developers&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;vibe coders&amp;rdquo;. It was the great democratisation of engineering, all of a sudden, everybody was of the same calibre of engineer, an expert on everything and able to propose solutions immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Practical DSP, FM Demodulation on the RTL-SDR</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are few things that I have put off learning more than Digital Signal Processing (DSP), namely because it sounded &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; maths-heavy. But recently I have been learning the basics alongside some projects involving the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rtl-sdr.com/&#34;&gt;RTL-SDR&lt;/a&gt;, the $40 USB Dongle to explore the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that there is some amount of maths that is unavoidable in DSP, the main prerequisite being the intuitive understanding of complex numbers, it really helps with wrapping your head around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is where I dump notes and ideas about embedded systems, firmware, and hardware acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No tutorials, no preaching, just the stuff I actually work on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that’s your thing, cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ben-kyd&#34;&gt;Ben Kyd&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded Acceleration &amp;amp; Firmware Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer, engineer, amature photographer and nature lover.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I work across embedded systems, electrical engineering, hardware acceleration, and graphics. I’m interested in the kind of problems that sit close to the metal-firmware, FPGAs, real-time performance, and systems where software and hardware are tightly coupled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked in roles spanning firmware engineering, embedded acceleration, open hardware development, and FPGA toolchains, with experience at companies like Intel and ChamSys, as well as through my own consultancy, Ben Labs Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
